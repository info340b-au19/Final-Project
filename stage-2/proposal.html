                    There are people with great artistical eyes who create beautiful and eye-pleasing blogs or slides.
                    On the other hand, there are people like me who always struggle to find out which set of colors would
                    make my project look nice. We have all the talent and skills needed to create sophisticated projects,
                    but we just cannot present them with great design!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if we create the next "Facebook" or "Amazon", people will simply ignore if they are not aesthetically
                    pleasing. Great design has become an important aspect for websites, program UI, and even power point slides.
                    Great design can also help many people who wants to show themselves on the web. It is a necessary skill
                    and aspect to have in your personal blogs to distinguish yourself from the rest and attract more people.

                    I personally use few websites that helps me choose colors for my slides or projects, but they have clear
                    limitations and problems that frustrate me every time. 
                    <a href="https://coolors.co/"><span class="link">Coolors.co</span></a> and 
                    <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create"><span class="link">Adobe Color</span></a> are two websites that
                    I use for exploring color sets to use on my work. With Coolor.co, I can generate, save, and share my own 
                    color palette and find other people's work. Adobe Color has similar features but also can be used to see
                    the color trend in various areas such as fashion and graphics design. However, these two big websites have
                    few problems in common. They do not let me search color sets with specific colors I have in mind, and it
                    is difficult to see the color sets in action without applying the set to my work. Thus, I am planning to 
                    make a web app that can help you design and present your work better.

                <p>
                    My project will be targeting graphics designer, UI designer, web developer, or anyone who needs an inspiration
                    for beautifully presenting information. Students can also benefit from this application as this can be used for
                    school projects and slides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The users can use this web app to create their own 5 color palette, save them as hex code or RGB values, and share
                    their color palette to the others. They can also explore other people's shared ideas, search palette with specific
                    set of colors. When they have a color palette in mind, they can see how it would look like on a demo webpage 
                    (their own if possible), or image of their work. It will also be very helpful if the users can extract a color 
                    palette from an uploaded photo, or randomly generate a set of color palette.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With these functionalities, the users will be able to easily pick a set of color and apply it on their work to 
                    find out which set would look best on their work. If they have a specific color that they really want to use, 
                    they can explore what others have done with that specific color to get more inspiration. When this web app comes
                    to life, it will definitely reduce the amount of effort that has to put in to make aesthetically pleasing work.
