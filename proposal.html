        <h1>Project Proposal - Color Palette Designer</h1>
        <section id="problem">
            <p>There are people with great artistical eyes who create beautiful and eye-pleasing blogs or slides.
                On the other hand, there are people like me who always struggle to find out which set of colors would
                make my project look nice. We have all the talent and skills needed to create sophisticated projects
                but we just cannot present them with great design!
            </p>
            <p>Even if we create the next "Facebook" or "Amazon", people will simply ignore if they are not aesthetically
                pleasing. Great design has become an important aspect for websites, program UI, and even power point slides.
                Great design can also help many people who wants to show themselves on the web. It is a necessary skill
                and aspect to have in your personal blogs to distinguish yourself from the rest and attract more people.
            </p>
            <p>I personally use few websites that helps me choose colors for my slides or projects, but they have clear
                limitations and problems that frustrate me every time. 
                <a href="https://coolors.co/"><span class="link">Coolors.co</span></a> and 
                <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create"><span class="link">Adobe Color</span></a> are two websites that
                I use for exploring color sets to use on my work. With Coolor.co, I can generate, save, and share my own 
                color palette and find other people's work. Adobe Color has similar features but also can be used to see
                the color trend in various areas such as fashion and graphics design. However, these two big websites have
                few problems in common. They do not let me search color sets with specific colors I have in mind, and it
                is difficult to see the color sets in action without applying the set to my work. Thus, I am planning to 
                make a web app that can help you design and present your work better.
